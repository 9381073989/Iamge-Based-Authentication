# Image Based Authentication

Image-based authentication is a process of verifying the identity of a user by using visual content such as photographs, biometric data, and other graphical elements. 
It is an important aspect of digital security that is used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. With the increasing use of digital 
devices and online platforms, image-based authentication has become an essential component of modern security systems.

Using images as a password is a type of image-based authentication where a user selects an image or set of images as their password instead of using alphanumeric 
characters. This approach is also known as graphical passwords, and it aims to provide an alternative to traditional text-based passwords that are often difficult 
to remember and can be easily cracked using brute force attacks.

Image-based authentication systems use images as a means to verify the identity of a user. These systems can be used in a variety of applications, such as online
banking, e-commerce, or social media platforms, where security is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.In an image-based authentication system, a user is 
typically required to provide an image or a set of images as part of the authentication process. The system then analyzes the images and compares them to a 
pre-defined database of images to verify the user's identity. The images can be in various forms, such as photographs, facial features, fingerprints, or handprints.
